                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>Loren & Baylee bring approximately 8 years of combined experience in both the sex work and tax preparation industries. What started as personal businesses—managing their own taxes and finances—quickly evolved into helping friends and family navigate the complexities of tax preparation for content creators and influencers.</p>
                
                <p>Today, we're proud to offer our services to the broader community, building on years of free coaching and networking support we've provided for over 5 years. Our mission is simple: earn your trust by preventing exploitation in the sex-work community and providing the organized, accurate tax preparation you deserve.</p>

                <h3>Accessible Communication</h3>
                <p>We know that communication is key to a stress-free tax experience. That's why we offer multiple ways to reach us: text, Telegram, Discord, or email—whatever works best for you. We respond quickly because we understand that tax questions don't always happen during business hours.</p>

                <h3>Research-Based Approach</h3>
                <p>Our approach to tax preparation is grounded in thorough research and continuous education. We reference:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>IRS audit training materials</li>
                    <li>Real tax court rulings</li>
                    <li>Continuing education specific to content creators and influencers</li>
                </ul>
                <p>This ensures that every deduction we claim is legitimate, well-documented, and defensible in the event of an audit.</p>

                <h3>Judgment-Free Philosophy</h3>
                <p>We understand that your business is unique, and we're here to help—not judge. Our judgment-free philosophy means you can be completely honest about your income streams, expenses, and concerns. We've seen it all, and we're here to support you every step of the way.</p>

                <h3>Compliant & Audit-Ready</h3>
                <p>While we maximize legal deductions to save you money, we never cut corners on compliance. Every return we prepare is audit-ready, meaning if the IRS ever questions your return, you'll have all the documentation and support you need.</p>

                <h3>Clear Explanations</h3>
                <p>Tax jargon can be confusing. We believe in explaining everything in simple terms so you understand your finances, your deductions, and why we're making the decisions we make. No surprises, no confusion—just clear, straightforward communication.</p>
